                <p class="badge badge-success">In Progress</p>
                <p>The Athena Framework makes up the base of the entire suite of tools. Based on <a href="https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap 4</a>, the framework will include most of the functionality developers and content editors have come to expect of Bootstrap. The base Bootstrap styles will be updated to conform to the UCF Brand by default, with additional variants for flexibility.</p>
                <p>For more information or to follow the development of the framework, visit the project's GitHub repository.</p>

                <p class="badge badge-primary">Upcoming</p>
                <p>A base theme for the popular blogging platform WordPress will be developed on top of the Athena Framework. The theme will come with a number of standard templates and layouts, with customization controlled through the Theme Customizr interface WordPress provides.</p>
                <p>While there will likely continue to be themes developed for particular purposes, this theme should provide a firm foundation on which many sites can be built.</p>

                <p>A companion plugin will be developed for the Athena theme to make using javascript components and markup heavy elements easier for content editors. This plugin would provide a number of shortcodes as well as a GUI for adding those shortcodes.</p>
